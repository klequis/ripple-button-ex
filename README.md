# Ripple Button Example

A React button with Material Design-like ripple effect.

There are two examples:
- RippleButtonCSS.jsx imports styles from a .css file
- RippleButtonJSS.jsx is the same code using react-jss


## Install
```js
$ git clone https://github.com/klequis/ripple-button-ex.git
$ cd react-button-ex
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

## Credits

I owe thanks to many people for the MERN stack skills I have acquired over the past several years and couldn't mention them all.
